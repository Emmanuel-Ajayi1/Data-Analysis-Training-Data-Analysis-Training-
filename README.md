**SALES DATA**

This data shows the daily chart of a global store that sells different types of products ranging from Paseo, Velo, VIC, Montana, Carretera, and so on.

In this task, we are to determine the total revenue and profit generated by using the **'SUM'** function for the sales column which can also be referred to as revenue and also the profit. 

In order to get the Average revenue and unit sold for every other we use the average function, the total discount was calculated by using the **'SUM'** function.

The total number of sales recorded was generated using the **'SUM'** function on the gross sales.

The highest profit generated was obtained by using the **'MAX'** FUNCTION. 

Lastly, the **'IF'** function was introduced to get the actual sales range whether it is **'High sales'** or **'low sales'**.
